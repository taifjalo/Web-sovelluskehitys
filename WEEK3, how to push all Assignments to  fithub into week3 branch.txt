i made already Assignment3 next is Assignment4

1. **Create Assignment4 from week3:**

   ```bash
   git checkout week3
   git pull
   git checkout -b Assignment4
   ```

2. Do your work for Assignment2.

3. Commit and push:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Assignment4 complete"
   git push -u origin Assignment4
   ```

4. Merge back into week3 when done:

   ```bash
   git checkout week3
   git merge Assignment4
   git push
   ```

---

That’s the **correct and clean structure** for week 3:

```
main
 └── week3
       ├── Assignment1
       ├── Assignment2
       ├── Assignment3
       └── Assignment4
