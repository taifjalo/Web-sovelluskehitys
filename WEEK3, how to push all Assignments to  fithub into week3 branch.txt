i made already Assignment4 next is Assignment5

1. **Create Assignment5 from week3:**

   ```bash
   git checkout week3
   git pull
   git checkout -b Assignment5
   ```

2. Do your work for Assignment5.

3. Commit and push:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Assignment5 complete"
   git push -u origin Assignment5
   ```

4. Merge back into week3 when done:

   ```bash
   git checkout week3
   git merge Assignment5
   git push
   ```

---




AFTER EACH Assignment Pushed:
git add .
git commit -m "Add instructions for pushing all assignments to week3"
git push


That’s the **correct and clean structure** for week 3:

```
main
 └── week3
       ├── Assignment1
       ├── Assignment2
       ├── Assignment3
       └── Assignment4
